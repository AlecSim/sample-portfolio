                <p>
                    I just graduated from a coding bootcamp. Before, I didn't know what I really wanted in my career, but when I experienced coding, I really liked it that's why I decided to take an intensive coding bootcamp to further hone my skills.<br /><br />I used to do Business Process Outsourcing, but now I'm becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. My previous job taught me multitasking and problem-solving, which I want to use for creating user-friendly websites.<br /><br />I'm eager to learn more about the latest web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I enjoy solving problems and I am now aiming to secure a job where I could work and do something that I love at the same time.
